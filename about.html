        <p>Hey there! I'm Alexandra Case, a passionate developer at IBM with a zest for technology and a love for learning. I graduated Michigan State University (May 2023) with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship, and I'm thrilled to be at the forefront of innovation.</p>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me out on a run, soaking in the fresh air and pushing my limits. Running is not just a physical exercise for me; it's a meditative practice that keeps me centered and focused. I consider it a personality trait.</p>
