        <p>Hey there! I'm Alexandra Case, and my nickname is Lexi! I graduated Michigan State University (May 2023) with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>The world of technology never ceases to amaze me. Its potential to transform lives and shape the future is unparalleled. I thrive on staying up-to-date with the latest trends and breakthroughs, always eager to delve deeper into this ever-evolving landscape.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me out on a run, soaking in the fresh air and pushing my limits. Running is not just a physical exercise for me; it's a meditative practice that keeps me centered and focused. I actually consider it a personality trait.</p>

        <p>I am all about having positive mindset, as it really has helped my mental health. I'm a strong advocate for the power of positive affirmations and quotes. I believe that the words we choose to embrace can profoundly impact our lives and shape our outlook. This philosophy drives me to seek out inspiration from books, TedTalks, social media, and share uplifting messages whenever I can. I created an instagram account where I like to post my favorite quotes on my free time</p>

  
        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>I approach each day with a strong commitment to personal growth both in and outside of work. I believe that the journey of self-improvement is a lifelong endeavor, and I'm dedicated to honing my skills, expanding my knowledge, cultivating a growth-oriented mindset, and achieving the goals I set for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                My next big goal? To run a full marathon (no walking). The thought of pushing myself to achieve this milestone is both exhilarating and motivating. It's a testament to my belief in the power of dedication and perseverance.
